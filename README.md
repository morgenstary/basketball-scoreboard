# To build a basketball scoreboard with HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

# The objective

After completing the basketball scoreboard challenge in Module 3 of the Scrimba Developer Career path I got some ideas on how I might like to improve it. I was at a fork in the road, I could keep moving on with the course or take a break and use my time to start a new project. Why not do both you ask? I have a very demanding full-time job in another industry and a family so I have very little free time, plus I'm old and old people need to sleep. Anyway, I started looking around the internet and found a site that makes digital scoreboards for basketball games (https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.XgyFHAMkt3YgoEDdcxhrcwHaEK%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=d8973bcf55c07bd40282cb0bd88ddcea0cb58f5b8b9640a720ec3b9edaa88fdf&ipo=images) and decided to use one of the images as inspiration for my next coding project, deciding to put my front-end course on hold until I finished it. My idea was this, using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript build a basketball scoreboard that someone could actually use at a real game. 


# How I work

Before any code was written the first part of the project was to conceptualize the overall design, how it was going to work for the user and then what features it would have. This involved coming up with the idea of the project having two main div elements that would be placed on one HTML page, one for the scoreboard and one for the user control panel. My objective with the control panel was to provide controls for the user to interact with and change the scoreboard. 

Next was conceptualizing the features of the scoreboard. Looking at the image of the scoreboard I found online it was clear that I would have to incorporate a clock that counted down, areas to display each teams’ score, an area for each teams’ logo, accounting for fouls, bonus, T.O.L., player/fouls, what period the game was in, as well as overtime. It was also clear that each of the aforementioned would have to be controlled by a user as simply as possible. So, with the objective and features conceptualized it was time to pseudocode and sketch.


# Sketching the idea & pseudocode

I started with completing a figma mockup of my scoreboard. I did this by using the image of the digital scoreboard I found online and recreating it. It wasn't too important for me to get it to look identical, the purpose was to get the layout sorted out, i.e. where I was going to put the clock, the team names, the scores, etc. 

Next was to create a figma sketch of my control panel. This was a little trickier than the scoreboard because I had nothing to reference. My idea was to make it as simple to understand as possible because I knew there was going to be a lot of buttons and inputs for the user to operate during a game. I consciously chose to have the control panel's controls mimic their placements on the scoreboard. For example, the inputs for "Event Name" is on top of both the scoreboard and control panel. There are a couple of exceptions, i.e. each teams’ naming controls and logo image uploads are toward the bottom on the control panel where they're toward the top on the scoreboard, I rationalized having them toward the bottom on the control panel as they would only be used once during a game. The "Scoreboard clear" button is also at the bottom because you don't want to accidentally hit that during a game.

After completing both the scoreboard and control panel in figma (https://www.figma.com/file/SOCtCfGFPyDq34K8wmIVyG/Basketball-Scoreboard-V2) it was time to start coding them in HTML & CSS. Refining and changing the layout as I was coding the HTML and CSS while pseudo coding the functionality, what would become the JavaScript. An example of this is line 61 of the HTML doc where I say "add letters "o" & "t" here when OT button is pressed". Another thing I was mindful of was making my code scalable. An example of this is how I approached the button states on the control panel. During the conceptualization phase I decided on having different states for each of the control panel buttons depending on user interaction. When the user hovers over a button I wanted the button to change to a different color and for the pointer to appear, a different color for when the user clicks the button, and a different state for mouse up. The pseudocode for this was to be able to change the color for all the buttons on the control panel (except for the scoring buttons) for "mousedown" from a single function, so that if say I wanted to change the color from yellow (where it is now) to orange it could be changed easily by changing the background color in one function, the pseudocode was simply "Control board button states and colors", a shorthand for what I would do later for the buttons. The final implementation of this is in the "Control board Button States and Colors" section in the script.js. A side note, from the start my goal was to build the project in layers, start with the concept and what the features would be, sketch out in figma, translate figma drawing to HTML/CSS, etc. For the most part I followed this approach but it was also important to be flexible and sometimes conceptualize, pseudocode, refine, and code at the same time. I think it's worthwhile having a certain approach that has a foundation however the process isn't a straight line, it's a process of execution and discovery.

After getting the HTML and CSS foundation established I started psuedocoding the functionality on the script page.
Most of the time the pseudocode was as simple as "Controlboard guest bonus control". At the same time, I started creating my variables (i.e. HTML buttons) and putting each bit of functionality in its own pseudocode "section" in my JS, i.e. "Controlboard add score", "Controlboard guest fouls control", etc. For some this might seem like a lot of extra work and time spent that could be coding but for me it's a good way to stay focused and organized, until I get enough experience and confidence at coding I'll continue leaning heavily with on pseudocode before coding approach. 


# Building it out

After finishing the pseudocode and as many variables as I could it was time to get down to it. Where to start? Looking at my control panel I guessed (and correctly, more on this later) that the timer was going to the most challenging so I decided to leave that for last, like confronting a final boss. I started with the "Event name" input, the goal with this bit of functionality was to enable a user to type in something in the input and have it appear on the scoreboard when pressing enter, the clear button is to clear the users input and set the placeholder text to default of "National Championships" in the input box and on the scoreboard. After finishing the event name input functionality, I moved onto the scoring for both teams, then bonus for both teams, and you get the picture. I worked on each bit of functionality one at a time and moved onto the next assembly line style, this allowed me to stay focused and easily pick it back up after I would take breaks. After getting all the functionality finished I was at a place to start working on the dreaded... timer.


# The Timer

The pseudocode for the timer was as follows: a countdown timer that starts counting down from a default of 12 minutes on button click, the timer will accept user input allowing the user to enter any time under 100 minutes, the timer will have stop/resume button click functionality, an ability to clear the time to the 12 minute default on button click, and an overtime button that set's the clock to 5 minutes while changing the color of the numbers and displaying the letter's "o" and "t" beside the clock on the scoreboard.

This was my first google search deep dive, coding a timer from scratch is well beyond my abilites at the moment. After a bit of searching around I finally found one that didn't rely on jQuery or date objects. It had a start, stop, and reset button but no way to accept user input. My challenge for over a week was to understand it well enough so that I could modify it to accept user input. I'm not going to lie this was really frustrating and time consuming. Stackoverflow and google searches didn't really help but I stuck with it and console.log'd my way to victory. User tip: set the clock to 00:01 and enter, click start and let countdown to 00:00 to hear the buzzer quickly.


# On getting stuck

There were many times during this project where I'd get stuck and hit a wall. Some function wouldn't work as expected, or at all, or my code would return errors in the console. Googling wouldn't help, or worse made me more confused. As frustrating as it was at times it's to be expected, I was building something that required me to learn new coding concepts and possibilities. I took breaks often, coding a little here and there, balancing my work/family life with the project. There were times when I'd want to compromise out of frustration, I considered scrapping the user input for the timer and just going with a static 12 minutes but I'm glad I didn't, I wouldn't have been satisfied with it. Sometimes the best thing to do was work on it for an hour and then when I'd get frustrated try again the next day, trying something different each time until I was able to see a path forward or get the desired result. My general approach was to be patient with myself and try and break down the problem down as far as I could. If the problem was a function that wasn't working, I'd try and break it down line by line of the function, trying to understand what each line did until it started becoming clearer to me what the problem might be. Sometimes it would take me a few days to understand how one function would interact with another, it was important to me to really understand how things worked and not reflexively try and google an answer. That's not to say that looking for help online is a bad thing, I did a lot of it and it was really helpful most of the time, just that it's also very important for me to really understand how and why code works. Persistence pays off.


# The final result

I feel satisfied and a sense of accomplishment now. I set out to create an interactive basketball scoreboard and met all my self-imposed requirements. There are a few features I'd like to add but those will wait for another time, I'd like to get refocused on completing my front-end course before the next new shiny object lures me away. One of the best ways to learn is to do. Every time I sat down to work on this project I learned something new or reinforced something that I'd already learned, like practicing a musical instrument. Sometimes the lesson was understanding how .foreach methods work, sometimes the lesson was practicing persistence. I have so many ideas and there's so much I'd like to do but I also have so much to learn. This project gave me a little more confidence in my ability to conceptualize something and turn it into something that works.
